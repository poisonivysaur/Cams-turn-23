      <h1>Catching Up...</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">So this is my first time writing an "electronic" birthday card (Github recently introduced last January 7 free unlimited private repositories as a way to start the new year to which this site is hosted privately)! The source code for this page is private in one of my Github repositories, meaning as of now only I know about this page and since I have shared the url link with you--that makes this webpage only known by you and me :3</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I decided this idea of hosting my letter in a website only you can see instead of private messages or hard copy letters so that you can easily access just the link anywhere with you if you have Internet connection without needing to login to anything xD ahihihihi hope you like it ❤️ Ok so I guess here's the start of the letter...</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">First of all HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my bestest friend in the entire universe!!! I wished I could have joined you last December with BS group, but many things have happened during the past few months that it took me quite some time to grasp everything and bounce back to myself. I did not felt Christmas at all for the very first time last 2018. It was because of my Angkong passed away, and everything after that was in a melancholic rhythm. I guess I was pretty down and heartbroken when my Angkong passed away, and I guess I finally felt what you felt way back in 2nd year when your Ama passed away 😢. Everyday felt like there was a nail pierced into my heart ever since the news that my Angkong was hospitalized came late November (The Sunday morning of Nov. 25, 2018). Ever since then I stopped going to church. When I went to hk for the wake, the aura was so gloomy and night after night I kept welling up tears to sleep. I guess I'm having those times in life wherein every ounce of life just got sucked out of you and you just feel dead inside. Those days I really hit bottom hard and I just thought to myself I wish I wouldn't wake up another day. I couldn't stop myself from shedding tears when I reminisce fresh memories of the times I spent with my Angkong. It was only last 2017 when I traveled alone to hk with my Angkong for the first time and spent precious memories--and they were the last. I can say that I stopped crying at night exactly a month after my Angkong joined with the Lord. I guess the most painful memories are the last few days talking with Angkong via phone call as since he was hospitalized in hk and I can't miss out on my thesis I defense and final exams. I really felt bitter during the last days of that cruel term. My apologies I think I have ranted too much and this is supposed to be a birthday greeting 😂😂😂 </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Anyway, I really prayed hard to God during those dark nights to gain back my motivation to live in this life, and Praise God He never fails 💪. As the new year comes, I can say that things will never be the same without Angkong, but God's faithfulness always stays, and hope is renewed. I feel back to myself now as of this writing, and I hope everything goes well with you too Cams.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I won't deny it but there are days wherein I think and worry about you if you are doing OK there in Taiwan. I hope and pray that you won't get tremendously sick there, and enjoy life while you still have the time and energy to. I wish you all the best and I hope you enjoy your day! 😊 Btw, you might want to watch Your Lie in April anime series if you have the time and if your into really nice classical music 🎵🎶🎻🎹 hehehehehe</p>
